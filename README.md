## Setting up the app

### TL;DR
If you have python 3.8.7 already installed
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Detailed Walk through
- You need a working version of python 3.8.7
- Update your pip to the latest version

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

- Install all the requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## For devs

- You must have MySQL installed. A default installation would be fine.
- Run all the files in the [Db](https://github.com/sssihl/cashlessbrn/tree/main/Db) folder to create the required schemas.
- Ask Suds for the default password.
- Now you need to run Python/main.py and the GUI loads.
